## Project Specifications

Create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training
<ul>
  <li> Back-end developed using Java</li>
  <li> Managed database</li>
  <li> A means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench/H2 console)</li>
</ul>

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>
    
## MVP Requirements
<ul>
  <li>A completed project management board </li>
  <li>Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the feature-branch model: main/dev/multiple features</li>
  <li>A risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project timeframe </li>
  <li>A relational database, which is used to persist data for the project. </li>
  <li>A functional application ‘back-end’, written in Java/Spring Boot, which meets the requirements set on your Jira board</li>
  <li>A build (.jar) of your application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using Maven. </li>
  <li>A series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality </li>
  <li>Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, including both unit and integration tests</li>
</ul>

## Why are we doing this
This project is the culmination of 9 weeks worth of learning with the QA Software Development Bootcamp. During this time we covered a variety of topics oncluding Java, Spring Boot, testing and MySQL along with many other things. To conclude this learning period we have been tasked with creating this project to put our knowledge and skills learnt to the test!
I have created a Pokemon app, that allows users to store Pokemon and their types within a database. The app has full CRUD functionality, two data entities with a one-to-many relationship, custom exceptions and fully designed test suites with coverage >80%.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## How I expected the challenge to go
I was pretty pessimistic going into the project initially as I felt I had barely grasped the concepts related to Spring Boot. I expected to struggle at nearly every point of creating the app. To my pleasant suprise I found that the majority of the time it was smooth-sailing, only getting stuck with errors I had not encountered before and trying to implement concepts that had not been covered in the bootcamp.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## What went well
First and foremost I have a fully functioning (basic) REST API with CRUD functionality. My integration and unit testing works as expected with >80% coverage (which took a very long time). I also was able to add two data entities to my project as a stretch goal, which have a one-to-many relationship.
Finally, and actually most importantly, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of getting lost in my project/code and look forward to expanding my knowledge and skillset to be able to create further and more complications projects.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## What didn't go as planned?
My SQL language recall was very rusty going into the project so it made the setup of MySQL databases a particularly slow and difficult process, for which I had to seek assistance for when MySQL refused to recognise Long or Boolean datatypes and I could only use BIGINTS and TINYINTS. I also attempted to use enums for the pokemon types however I also wanted to set this up as a data entity. I spent quite a long time on this and eventually had to abandon this task. I do now see how I could use enums in my project but time did not allow for me to implement this.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Possible improvements for future revisions
As mentioned above I would like to implement enums to restrict the pokemon types that can be inputted. I would also like to include further custom queries such as 'find by type' as I originally intended and to include the use of DTOs. Finally, a front end would be important to implement but this was outside the scope of this project.
